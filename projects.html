                        Many brands and companies have established franchises in various regions of the world in recent years to expand their business, but there is a lack of a reliable platform where shop owners can communicate with franchise owners. 
                        This application will let store owners search different franchise and get full information on franchises and allow them to submit a proposal request for a franchise. The franchisor will be able to check the locations of shop owners and approve or reject their proposal. 
                        Once the franchisor has approved the proposal, the store owner can make a payment to finalize the agreement and receive the invoice. -->
